This is 'SnapShops', a website that we had to build during a weekend hackathon.
----
We wanted to create a clean, simple design so that the focus was on the user content.
On the back end code, we used **Node.JS**, **Express**, and **Sequelize**. The routes were tested using **PostMan**.
On the front end side, we demonstrated our understanding of **AngularJS** and using **UI Routers** for the views.
This was the first application we built from scratch that we *proudly* integrated the Front and Back ends to create a functioning webpage and database.
